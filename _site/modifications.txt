Remove the start, getting started, templates, header styles, documentation tabs from the navigation bar. And remove all of their routes and drop down menus as well. 

Remove the search and contact buttons as well from the right bit of the nav bar. 

For the blog button - remove the drop down menu - pressing the button should redirect to /blog or whatever the relevant URL is. no blog archive thingy. e
